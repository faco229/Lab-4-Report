## Discussion
**Part 1**
a.	Compare the performance of each amplifier circuit to its expected theoretical performance with regard to gain.
b.	Comment on the limits of op-amp circuits with respect to maximum output voltage.
c.	Are the LM741 op amps symmetric i.e. does the positive voltage performance equal the negative voltage performance?


**Part 2**
Did the integrating and differentiating circuits perform the mathematical operations expected?  Explain.

## Conclusion

Summarize the most important things learned from the lab. Provide one or two paragraphs that encapsulate:
- The key findings.
- Lessons derived from the work.
- Implications for future work or further investigation.
